 Notebooks completed and Certifications obtained as part of the 10MillionAI Project hosted by Global AI Hub
 Courses completed:
 1. Introduction to Python 
 This course emphasized the use of Python as a programming language, its data structures, syntax, indentation etc. 
 The assessment questions were very useful to understand the language and the subtle differences in its implementation.

 2. Python for Machine Learning
 This course emphasized the use of Python in Machine Learning, the versatility of its libraries, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib mainly.
 It also emphasized the mining, cleaning, and visualization of data via the use of above mentioned libraries.
 With the help of assessments and guided projects, all the implementation of the theory was taught and explained.

 3. Introduction to Machine Learning
This course gave a very strong theoretical foundation of the different problems that can be solved using various Machine Learning models.
The course gave a very simply explanation of all the Machine Learning models and the different techniques used to solve problems using such models.
The final project and assessments helped to consolidate all the knowledge obtained via this course.
